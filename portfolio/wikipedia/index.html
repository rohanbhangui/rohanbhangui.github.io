    <div class="shots-container">
      <div class="shots shot-1">
        <img src="wikipedia-1.png" />
        <p>So I started with custom glyphs and worked on 2 styles, one with upper case and one with lower case. I decided to move to less of a serif look for the font and more of a san-serif typeface.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="shots shot-2">
        <img src="wikipedia-2.png" />
        <p>Here I combined the two types of logos I had in the previous shot to form this one.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="shots shot-3">
        <img src="wikipedia-3.png" />
        <p>I soon found that the problem with the previous logo is that it is very much different from the current Wikipedia logo and so it would not be a good transition. Instead I used the first concept I drew and iterated over it to produce something to my saticfaction. The significance of the aqua stroke on the 'A' is that it shows that wikipedia, and more importantly wikimedia, is like a universe of knowledge. The stroke reminds me of a ring around a planet.</p>
